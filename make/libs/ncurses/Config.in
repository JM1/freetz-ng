		ncurses is a programming library providing an API, allowing the

		manner. It also optimizes screen changes, in order to reduce the
		latency experienced when using remote shells.

		Ncurses stands for "new curses", and is a replacement for the
		discontinued 4.4 BSD classic curses.

		keeping can be tedious and difficult to get right. Hence the panels
